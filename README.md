# Sign_Detection-Alphabet

Sign detection of alphabets using hand gestures is an innovative approach that leverages computer vision and deep learning to interpret hand signs representing different letters. This system captures hand movements through a webcam or camera, processes the input using image recognition techniques, and identifies the corresponding alphabet. A convolutional neural network (CNN) is often used to train on hand gesture datasets, enabling accurate classification of signs. This technology plays a crucial role in assisting people with hearing and speech impairments by converting sign language into readable or audible text. It can be applied in real-time communication tools, educational software, and human-computer interaction systems, making communication more inclusive and accessible for everyone.
